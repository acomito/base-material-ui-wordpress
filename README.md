## What You're Working With

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [React-Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
* [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)
* [Formsy-React](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react)
* [Formsy-Material-UI](https://github.com/mbrookes/formsy-material-ui)
* [The Meteor Chef's Base Repo](http://themeteorchef.com/base)
* [okgrow:rest2ddp](https://github.com/okgrow/rest2ddp)
* [An array of different meteor packages to make developing your app (and serving it) much easier](https://github.com/acomito/react-material-ui-wordpress/blob/master/.meteor/packages)
* ES2015 (and beyond) support.
* Redux, mobx, or flux are *NOT* incorporated at this time
* This does *NOT* have accounts setup (although it would be trivial to set up). It is just a front-end to consume your WP back-end.
* And of course you'll be connecting with your WordPress site's API (not included in this package)

## Getting Started

#### See Meteor Chef's Base 
As the projects are essentially the same, see https://themeteorchef.com/base/getting-started/

#### Clone Repo
`git clone https://github.com/acomito/react-material-ui-wordpress.git <directory>`

#### Setup the call to WP API

* Make sure you have the wordpress api plugin installed on your wordpress website. [this youtube video may be helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yeW5sntRRU)
* go into `base-material-ui-wordpress` into `imports/startup/server/rest2ddp.js` (here)[https://github.com/acomito/react-material-ui-wordpress/blob/master/imports/startup/server/rest2ddp.js). Then add your endpoint/url for your blog posts, etc. (see rest2dpp docs for more info)

#### Run NPM Install

* run `meteor npm install`
* after runnning `meteor npm install`, sometimes I find it is good to also run regular `npm install` just in case

#### Run Start Script

run `meteor npm start` to fire upt the app

#### Got to LocalHost:3000 and you should be good

* If you've setup the API on your WordPress site and added the relevant url to the posts call in your meteor app, then you should be pulling in a basic list of blog posts from your WP site.

What is different:



## Changes from ORIGINAL Base - Overall

* added material-ui with `meteor npm install material-ui`
* added `formsy-react` and `formsy-react-material-ui`
* added `react-tap-event-plugin` with `meteor npm install --save react-tap-event-plugin`
* uses formsy instead of jquery and jquery validation
* uses rest2dpp package to query 





## Other Stuff
* [How to Do a FAB in the corner] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35828991/make-material-ui-reactjs-floatingactionbutton-float)
* 

## TODO

* Add PropTypes where needed (basically, everywhere at this point.)
* it would be cool to tie bert-alert color schemes into the material-ui color scheme
* decision: combine delete-dialog and update-dialog components?
* decision: flexbox grid? bootstrap grid? grid agnostic?
* where it makes sense, extract inline-js css styles to the .scss files
* Add file for customizing the Material-UI theme
* Keep an eye out for new version of Material-UI... errors since react updated (https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/unknown-prop.html)
* Re-add re-routing logic (login, reset, etc. etc.)
* Collapsable nav and other responsive work
* improve documentation
* you have to click off the input field for formsy to validate and change the submit button from disabled... minor UI blemish.
* **Consider Other Versions:**
* base/boilerplate for a blog/portfolio website
* base/boilerplates with mobx/redux/flow/relay/graphql

## DONE
* ~~re-add validation for password-reset form~~
* ~~wire up the username to be in top-right corner of authenticated navbar (was getting an odd error when trying to do this so I just hardcoded "username" there for now)~~
